# malware-huntpy
A set of handy tools written in Python for malware hunting and related data processing. 

## Tool box
### pdfutil
Tools to process pdf files
#### link_fectcher  
Print out all links embedded in PDF files in a given dir. Sorted. Cannot process files bigger than 2MB because of pydf2json. I chose pydf2json because it handles decompression for "/FlateDecode" items.  


## Requirements
Tools might requires different python enviroments. Here is a list per tool. 
### pdfutil
* python 2.7
* pycrypto
* pydf2json
